## Overview

This plan implements the requirements defined in
`work/design/p37-f5-spec-work-tree-migration.md` (FEAT-01KQ7JDT511BZ). It covers
the `kbz migrate` CLI subcommand: target-path resolution, dry-run report generation,
`--execute` bulk-move mode, `--execute --cleanup` empty-folder removal, `--porcelain`
machine-readable output, `--resume` support, and the full test suite verifying all 17
acceptance criteria.

This plan does **not** cover:
- Filename validation or type enforcement (F2, `FEAT-01KQ7JDSZARPC`)
- The `kbz move` implementation (F3, `FEAT-01KQ7JDT11MH6`)
- The `kbz delete` implementation (F4, `FEAT-01KQ7JDT341E8`)
- Any changes to `.kbz/state/` entity files other than document records

**Critical dependency:** This feature MUST NOT be implemented until F2, F3, and F4
are fully merged into `main`. T3 and T4 call into `runMove` and `runDelete`, which
do not exist until those features land.

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Implement target-path resolver

- **Description:** Implement the pure functions that, given a document record,
  resolve the canonical target path under the plan-first folder structure. Handles
  three owner cases: Feature ID (load feature → parent plan), Plan ID (use directly),
  and PROJECT/absent (→ `work/_project/`). Constructs the target filename as
  `{PlanID}-{type}-{slug}.{ext}` (or `{type}-{slug}.{ext}` for `_project`). Also
  implements legacy-folder type inference for triage (maps `work/specs/` → `spec`,
  `work/dev-plans/` → `dev-plan`, `work/retros/` → `retro`,
  `work/evaluation/`/`work/eval/` → `report`, `work/dev/` → `dev-plan`).
- **Deliverable:** `resolveMigrateTarget` and `inferTypeFromPath` functions in
  `cmd/kanbanzai/migrate_cmd.go`; they take document records and entity service
  references, return target path string and error.
- **Depends on:** None (pure logic; entity/plan service interfaces already exist).
- **Effort:** Medium
- **Spec requirement:** REQ-002, REQ-011; AC-002, AC-003, AC-004, AC-012

### Task 2: Implement dry-run report generator

- **Description:** Implement the default (no-flag) behaviour of `kbz migrate`:
  read all document records via the document service; for each, call the resolver
  from T1 and classify as `MOVE`, `SKIP`, or `MISSING`. Apply exclusions:
  `work/templates/` entries always emit `SKIP`; `docs/` entries are omitted
  entirely. Also scan `work/` for files with no document record and emit the triage
  report with inferred type and recommended action (`REGISTER_AND_MOVE`, `ARCHIVE`,
  `DELETE`, `REVIEW`). Implement `--porcelain` flag: when set, suppress all headers
  and emit tab-separated `ACTION\tSOURCE\tTARGET` lines only.
- **Deliverable:** `runMigrate` function (dry-run path) in `migrate_cmd.go`; `case
  "migrate"` entry in `cmd/kanbanzai/main.go`; human-readable and `--porcelain`
  output formatters.
- **Depends on:** T1
- **Effort:** Medium
- **Spec requirement:** REQ-001, REQ-003, REQ-004, REQ-005, REQ-006, REQ-007,
  REQ-013, REQ-014, REQ-NF-001, REQ-NF-002, REQ-NF-003;
  AC-001, AC-005, AC-006 (dry-run half), AC-007, AC-008, AC-014, AC-015, AC-016,
  AC-017

### Task 3: Implement --execute mode

- **Description:** Extend `runMigrate` to handle `--execute`: iterate the computed
  MOVE list and call `runMove` (from F3) for each entry; delete document records for
  MISSING entries by calling the delete service (from F4). Collect all staged changes
  and produce a single atomic Git commit with the message
  `chore(work): migrate work tree to plan-first folder structure`. On any `runMove`
  failure, stop immediately, print the failing file and error, leave already-staged
  moves intact, and exit non-zero. Implement `--resume`: before each move, check
  whether the source is already staged in Git and skip it if so.
- **Deliverable:** `--execute` and `--resume` branches of `runMigrate`; atomic commit
  logic using the existing `git` internal package.
- **Depends on:** T2; F2 (`FEAT-01KQ7JDSZARPC` merged), F3 (`FEAT-01KQ7JDT11MH6`
  merged), F4 (`FEAT-01KQ7JDT341E8` merged)
- **Effort:** Large
- **Spec requirement:** REQ-007, REQ-008, REQ-009, REQ-012;
  AC-006 (execute half), AC-009, AC-010, AC-013

### Task 4: Implement --execute --cleanup mode

- **Description:** After a successful `--execute` run, when `--cleanup` is also set,
  scan `work/` for directories that are now empty (excluding `work/templates/` and
  `work/_project/`). List the empty directories in output. Remove them with
  `git rm -r` and produce a second Git commit with the message
  `chore(work): remove empty legacy type-first folders`. If no directories are empty,
  skip the second commit and log accordingly.
- **Deliverable:** `--cleanup` branch of `runMigrate`; empty-directory detection and
  `git rm -r` invocation via the internal git package.
- **Depends on:** T3
- **Effort:** Small
- **Spec requirement:** REQ-010; AC-011

### Task 5: Tests — all 17 acceptance criteria

- **Description:** Write the full test suite for the migrate command. Unit tests for
  `resolveMigrateTarget` (three owner cases) and `inferTypeFromPath` (all legacy
  aliases). Integration tests using `testutil` temp-repo helpers for dry-run
  behaviour, SKIP/MISSING classification, triage report, `--execute` atomic commit,
  partial-failure halt and `--resume` recovery, `--execute --cleanup` second commit,
  idempotency, `work/templates/` and `docs/` exclusions, and `--porcelain` output
  format. Performance benchmark asserting dry-run completes in under 10 seconds for
  1,000 records and 1,000 files.
- **Deliverable:** `cmd/kanbanzai/migrate_cmd_test.go` with tests covering AC-001
  through AC-017.
- **Depends on:** T1, T2, T3, T4
- **Effort:** Large
- **Spec requirement:** All 17 acceptance criteria (AC-001–AC-017)

## Dependency Graph

```
T1  (no dependencies)
T2  → depends on T1
T3  → depends on T2, F2 (merged), F3 (merged), F4 (merged)
T4  → depends on T3
T5  → depends on T1, T2, T3, T4
```

Parallel groups: [T1] is the unblocked start; T2 follows T1; T3 is gated on T2
and three external merges; T4 and T5 follow T3/T4 respectively.

Critical path: T1 → T2 → T3 (+ F2 + F3 + F4) → T4 → T5

## Interface Contracts

The following function signatures define the boundaries between tasks and constrain
how sub-agents must implement each deliverable.

### `resolveMigrateTarget` (T1)

```go
// resolveMigrateTarget returns the canonical target path for a document record
// under the plan-first folder structure. Returns the unchanged source path and
// action SKIP if the file is already in the correct location, MISSING if the
// source file does not exist on disk, or MOVE with the computed target path.
func resolveMigrateTarget(
    rec storage.DocumentRecord,
    entitySvc *service.EntityService,
    planSvc  *service.PlanService,
) (action string, targetPath string, err error)
```

### `inferTypeFromPath` (T1)

```go
// inferTypeFromPath infers the document type from a file path using the
// canonical folder name and legacy folder aliases defined in REQ-011.
// Returns empty string if the type cannot be inferred.
func inferTypeFromPath(path string) string
```

### `runMigrate` (T2, T3, T4)

```go
// runMigrate is the top-level entry point for the migrate subcommand.
// Flags parsed from args:
//   --execute   perform moves and commit
//   --cleanup   (requires --execute) remove empty legacy folders in second commit
//   --porcelain tab-separated output, no headers
//   --resume    skip already-staged files when --execute is set
func runMigrate(args []string, deps dependencies) error
```

### Risk Assessment

#### Risk: Dependency sequencing on F2, F3, and F4

- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** High — T3 cannot be implemented without `runMove` (F3) and the delete
  service (F4). If those features slip, this feature is blocked.
- **Mitigation:** Develop and review T1 and T2 in parallel with F2/F3/F4. Define
  compile-time function references for `runMove` and `runDelete` so T3 can be
  drafted before the real implementations land. Gate T3's merge on confirmed merge
  of F2, F3, and F4.
- **Affected tasks:** T3, T4, T5

#### Risk: Orphaned records for missing files

- **Probability:** High (28+ unregistered files already known; orphaned records
  likely among the 430 registered docs)
- **Impact:** Medium — `--execute` must not fail or skip silently when a source file
  is absent; incorrect handling would leave the document registry inconsistent.
- **Mitigation:** T2 classifies MISSING as a first-class action in the dry-run
  report. T3 calls the delete service for MISSING entries before attempting file
  moves. Integration tests in T5 explicitly exercise this path (AC-006, AC-010).
- **Affected tasks:** T2, T3, T5

#### Risk: Atomic commit failure partway through 430 moves

- **Probability:** Low
- **Impact:** High — a partial commit would leave the work tree inconsistent with
  some records updated and some not.
- **Mitigation:** T3 stages all moves before committing (never calls `git commit`
  until all `runMove` calls succeed). On failure it halts with prior moves staged
  but not committed. The `--resume` flag detects already-staged files and skips
  them, enabling recovery without re-running successful moves. AC-010 validates
  this behaviour.
- **Affected tasks:** T3, T5

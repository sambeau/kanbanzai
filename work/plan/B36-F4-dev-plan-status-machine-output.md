## Scope

This plan implements the machine-readable output formats (`--format plain` and `--format json`)
for the `kbz status` command as specified in
`work/spec/B36-F4-spec-status-machine-output.md` (FEAT-01KQ2VHKJB5V8/spec-b36-f4-spec-status-machine-output).

It covers four vertical slices:

1. **Plain format renderer** — key:value output for all six scope types (feature, plan, task,
   bug, document, project), with exhaustive schemas per FR-3 through FR-7.
2. **JSON format renderer** — structured JSON output for all scope types with results-array
   wrapping (D-7), distinct project overview shape (D-8), and full schemas per FR-9–FR-10.
3. **Schema stability contract test** — automated test that asserts the presence of every
   required plain key and JSON field across all scope types (NFR-1.5).
4. **Integration and verification** — wiring into the `kbz status` command, integration tests
   covering all 11 acceptance criteria, and performance verification (NFR-2.1).

It does **not** cover:

- `--format human` output (B36-F3)
- The argument resolution and routing logic (B36-F2 — dependency)
- Any MCP server tool changes; the CLI renderers consume service-layer data, same as the MCP
  `status` tool already does
- Multi-target queries (Q-1 — deferred)

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Plain format renderer

- **Description:** Implement a plain-format renderer that consumes the existing service-layer
  synthesis structs (`projectOverview`, `featureDetail`, `planDashboard`, `taskDetail`,
  `bugDetail`, and document data from `service.DocumentResult`) and emits `key: value` lines
  per the schemas in FR-3 through FR-7. Handle edge cases: `missing` for null values,
  `registered: true/false` on documents, single `attention:` line (highest severity), and
  `none` for empty attention. The renderer must be a pure function (no I/O, no side effects)
  taking a typed input per scope and returning `io.Writer`-writable output.
- **Deliverable:** `internal/cli/status/plain.go` — contains a `PlainRenderer` struct with
  per-scope methods: `RenderFeature(*mcp.FeatureDetail)`, `RenderPlan(*mcp.PlanDashboard)`,
  `RenderTask(*mcp.TaskDetail)`, `RenderBug(*mcp.BugDetail)`,
  `RenderDocument(*service.DocumentResult)`, `RenderProject(*mcp.ProjectOverview)`.
- **Depends on:** None (consumes existing types from `internal/mcp` and `internal/service`)
- **Effort:** Medium
- **Spec requirements:** FR-1.2, FR-1.3, FR-2, FR-3, FR-4, FR-5, FR-6, FR-7

**Key design decisions:**

- The renderer accepts typed structs directly, not a `map[string]any` or `any` — each scope
  has its own method with the exact struct from the service layer. This avoids reflection and
  makes the contract explicit.
- `missing` is the sentinel for null/absent values. For documents specifically, `registered`
  is always present and is `true` or `false`.
- The `attention` field emits only the highest-severity item's message (error > warning), or
  `none` when empty.
- Keys are emitted in a fixed order matching the spec schemas; a struct field tag convention
  (e.g. `plain:"doc.design"`) drives ordering without hard-coded switch statements.

**Interface contract (consumed by Task 4):**

```go
// PlainRenderer writes plain key:value status output to w.
type PlainRenderer struct{}

func (r *PlainRenderer) RenderFeature(w io.Writer, d *mcp.FeatureDetail) error
func (r *PlainRenderer) RenderPlan(w io.Writer, d *mcp.PlanDashboard) error
func (r *PlainRenderer) RenderTask(w io.Writer, d *mcp.TaskDetail) error
func (r *PlainRenderer) RenderBug(w io.Writer, d *mcp.BugDetail) error
func (r *PlainRenderer) RenderDocument(w io.Writer, d *service.DocumentResult) error
func (r *PlainRenderer) RenderProject(w io.Writer, p *mcp.ProjectOverview) error
```

---

### Task 2: JSON format renderer

- **Description:** Implement a JSON-format renderer that consumes the same service-layer
  structs and emits RFC 8259 JSON. Entity/document queries are wrapped in `{"results": [...]}`
  per D-7. The project overview uses `{"scope": "project", ...}` per D-8. Each scope type
  has a distinct JSON schema matching FR-9 and FR-10 exactly. Edge cases: `null` for missing
  references (not absent), `[]` for empty attention (never `null`), `registered: false` with
  `id: null` for unregistered documents. Single-line compact JSON via `json.Marshal`, not
  `MarshalIndent`, matching the requirement that output be parseable by `jq` without flags.
- **Deliverable:** `internal/cli/status/json.go` — contains a `JSONRenderer` struct with
  per-scope methods: `RenderFeature`, `RenderPlan`, `RenderTask`, `RenderBug`,
  `RenderDocument`, `RenderProject`.
- **Depends on:** None (consumes existing types)
- **Effort:** Medium
- **Spec requirements:** FR-8, FR-9 (FR-9.1 through FR-9.6), FR-10

**Key design decisions:**

- Each `Render*` method constructs an intermediate struct that maps 1:1 to the spec's JSON
  schema, then calls `json.Marshal`. The intermediate structs use `json:` struct tags
  matching the spec's `snake_case` field names exactly.
- `feature.plan_id` is `null` (JSON `null`) when the feature has no parent plan, not absent.
- `documents` in the feature result always contains keys for all three document types
  (`design`, `spec`, `dev-plan`), mapped to `null` when not registered.
- Document `id` is `null` when `registered` is `false` (unregistered docs have no ID).
- Project overview is NOT wrapped in `results` — it uses `{"scope": "project", ...}` as
  the top-level shape.
- `health.errors` and `health.warnings` are computed from attention items at query time,
  not cached.

**Interface contract (consumed by Task 4):**

```go
type JSONRenderer struct{}

func (r *JSONRenderer) RenderFeature(w io.Writer, d *mcp.FeatureDetail) error
func (r *JSONRenderer) RenderPlan(w io.Writer, d *mcp.PlanDashboard) error
func (r *JSONRenderer) RenderTask(w io.Writer, d *mcp.TaskDetail) error
func (r *JSONRenderer) RenderBug(w io.Writer, d *mcp.BugDetail) error
func (r *JSONRenderer) RenderDocument(w io.Writer, d *service.DocumentResult) error
func (r *JSONRenderer) RenderProject(w io.Writer, p *mcp.ProjectOverview) error
```

### Task 3: Schema stability contract test

- **Description:** Implement a contract test that enumerates every required key from the
  plain schemas (FR-3 through FR-7) and every required field from the JSON schemas (FR-9
  through FR-10), then asserts their presence in the output of each command variant. The
  test seeds a minimal project with one of each entity type, runs `kbz status` with `--format
  plain` and `--format json` for each scope type, and verifies that all expected keys/fields
  are present. This test must run in CI and fail on key/field removal.
- **Deliverable:** `internal/cli/status/contract_test.go`
- **Depends on:** Task 1, Task 2 (needs both renderers to exist)
- **Effort:** Small
- **Spec requirements:** NFR-1.1, NFR-1.2, NFR-1.5, AC-11

**Key design decisions:**

- The test maintains a `requiredPlainKeys` map keyed by scope type (e.g.
  `"feature" → []string{"scope", "id", "slug", "status", ...}`) and a `requiredJSONFields`
  map similarly keyed. These maps are the authoritative schema reference — they are checked
  against the spec, and the test asserts the renderers produce them.
- Seeding uses the test helpers already available in `cmd/kanbanzai/main_test.go`
  (`newFakeEntityService`, `setupTestGitRepo`).
- CI integration via `go test ./internal/cli/status/...` in the existing CI workflow.

---

### Task 4: Integration and verification

- **Description:** Wire the plain and JSON renderers into the `kbz status` command path,
  behind the `--format` flag (which B36-F2 routes). Implement the document-by-path lookup
  path (call `DocumentService.ListDocuments` with a path filter, produce a
  `DocumentResult` for the renderers). Add integration tests covering all 11 ACs
  (AC-1 through AC-11), plus performance verification for NFR-2.1 (<2s for 200-feature
  project). Wire into the existing `cmd/kanbanzai/main.go` switch by extending the
  `runStatus` function to accept and route `--format`.
- **Deliverable:** Modified `cmd/kanbanzai/workflow_cmd.go` (format flag routing),
  `internal/cli/status/status.go` (dispatcher that calls service-layer synthesis + renderer),
  and `cmd/kanbanzai/status_format_test.go` (integration tests).
- **Depends on:** Task 1, Task 2, B36-F2 (argument resolution)
- **Effort:** Large
- **Spec requirements:** FR-1.1, FR-11, NFR-2.1, NFR-3.1, NFR-3.2, AC-1 through AC-11

**Key design decisions:**

- The dispatcher function in `internal/cli/status/status.go` follows this flow:
  1. Call the appropriate `synthesise*` function from `internal/mcp` (same as the MCP tool).
  2. Dispatch to the correct renderer method based on `--format` and scope type.
  3. Write to stdout; errors go to stderr.
- Document-path lookup: `DocumentService.ListDocuments(DocumentFilters{})` is filtered
  client-side by `Path` match. Multiple matches is an error. No match produces an
  unregistered-document result (`registered: false`).
- Exit code `0` for all successful queries including those with `health.errors > 0` or
  `registered: false`.
- Performance: The existing service-layer synthesis is already fast — the renderers add
  negligible overhead. If the 200-feature threshold is breached, the fix is in the
  service layer, not the renderers.

## Dependency Graph

```
Task 1 (plain renderer) ──┐
                           ├── Task 3 (contract test)
Task 2 (JSON renderer) ───┘       │
                                   │
B36-F2 (argument resolution) ─────┤
                                   │
                           Task 4 (integration + verification)
```

**Parallel groups:** [Task 1, Task 2] can execute in parallel — they share no state and both
consume the same existing service-layer types as read-only inputs.

**Critical path:** Task 1 → Task 4 (Task 4 needs both renderers, and Task 2 runs in parallel
with Task 1; the longer of the two determines the start of Task 4).

## Risk Assessment

### Risk: Service-layer struct mismatch with spec schemas

- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium — the existing MCP status structs have more fields than the CLI output
  schemas require (e.g. `taskInfo` has `Estimate`, `Name`; feature has `ReviewCycle`,
  `BlockedReason`). The renderers must subset these structs to match the spec exactly.
- **Mitigation:** Each renderer method constructs an intermediate output-specific type rather
  than serializing the service struct directly. The contract test (Task 3) catches any
  drift between the intermediate type and the spec schema.
- **Affected tasks:** Task 1, Task 2, Task 3

### Risk: B36-F2 delay blocks integration

- **Probability:** Low
- **Impact:** High — Task 4 depends on B36-F2 for argument resolution and routing. Without
  it, the `--format` flag cannot be parsed and dispatched.
- **Mitigation:** The renderers (Task 1, Task 2) are independent of B36-F2 and can be built
  and tested in isolation. The contract test (Task 3) can also run against the renderers
  directly without the CLI routing layer. Only Task 4 is blocked.
- **Affected tasks:** Task 4

### Risk: Document path lookup returns multiple records

- **Probability:** Low
- **Impact:** Low — the current document store enforces path uniqueness per ID convention.
  If it occurs, it's a data integrity issue, not a renderer bug.
- **Mitigation:** The dispatcher returns an error if multiple records match the path. The
  integration test (Task 4) includes a multi-match error case.
- **Affected tasks:** Task 4
